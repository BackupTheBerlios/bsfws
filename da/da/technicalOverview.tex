Technically, BWS is split in two parts: The first one transforms a BWS document meeting the requirements stated in section \ref{sec:XHTMLDocumentsAsStartingPoint} to a browser interpretable HTML document the second one provides the runtime environment that connects the different technologies necessary for script execution and DOM integration.

As depicted in figure \ref{fig:TechnicalOverviewOfBWS}, the first part of BWS, document rewriting, can be integrated into the second one so that working with BWS document for the user is no different to working with conventional HTML documents.
