Java is an object oriented programming language developed by Sun and available since 1995. Java, from the beginning of its development, was designed to be a platform independent programming language: The concept of Java consists of a 'two-step' approach in compiling and running Java programs, the source code is compiled into a platform independent 'bytecode' that is then interpreted by a bytecode interpreter, the Java virtual machine (JVM).

One of the reasons why Java was created platform independent was to make Java the dominant programming language of the 'internet age', by being totally platform independent, Java can be downloaded on any computer and executed directly on the JVM without further steps by the user.
