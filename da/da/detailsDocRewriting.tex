Document rewriting is the process of rewriting a BWS document conforming to the requirements defined in section \ref{sec:CreatingBWSApplications} to HTML documents interpretable by the browser. To achieve this, BWS script calls must be transformed to JavaScript calls calling Applet methods and the BWS runtime environment, the \texttt{BWSApplet} class, must be embedded in the document. As shown if figure \ref{fig:TechnicalOverviewOfBWS}, this process can be run separatly from the application execution itself or it can be run inside the BWSApplet; then of course the applet must be embedded beforehand by the creator of the BWS document.
