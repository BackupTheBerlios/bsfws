Just for running a simple BWS document that uses only Java base script engines\footnote{E.g. Rhino or NetRexx.} and does not need to leave the Java sandbox, an installation is not necessary. BWS itself comes as an applet embedded in a BWS/HTML document and the java archive containing the applet may contain the scripting engine too. If, however, the scripting engine is not contained in the Java archive, the scripting engines archive as well as the BSF java archive must be in the Java \texttt{CLASSPATH} environment variable of the Java Runtime Environment used in the browser.

For non-Java based scripting engines, like the BSF4Rexx engine, it is also necessary to make the libraries containing the engine available in the library path of the Java Runtime Environment. On MS Windows systems, this can be done by setting the \texttt{PATH} environment variable to include the path of the scripting engine's library; on Unix systems, the \texttt{java.library.path} of the Java Runtime Environment must be adapted to include the engine's libraries.
