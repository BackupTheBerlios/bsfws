At the time of writing (first quarter of 2004), three solutions for developing client side browser based applications exist\footnote{An additional option for creating client side web application is \emph{Curl}, available from \cite{CurlHp}. Curl, developed by the Curl Corporation, is not based on HTML but uses a proprietary document format run inside the web browser using a Runtime Environment provided as browser plugin. As Curl does not provide real integration with web browsers, it is not discussed further in this document, see \cite{CurlCWP}.}: JavaScript and Java are two platform neutral options for developing such applications, Microsoft's ActiveScripting is an option for applications that only need to run on the MS Windows/Internet Explorer platform.
